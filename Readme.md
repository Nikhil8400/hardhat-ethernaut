# Hardhat Ethernaut

Welcome to the Hardhat Ethernaut repository! 🚀 This project contains solutions for all the Ethernaut challenges implemented using Hardhat, a powerful development environment for Ethereum.

## Project Structure

- **contracts:** This directory holds all the Ethereum smart contracts, each corresponding to an Ethernaut challenge.

- **tests:** Explore the test folder to find comprehensive test suites for each contract. These tests ensure the correctness and functionality of the solutions.

## Getting Started

To compile all the contracts, run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

To run tests for a specific contract, use the following command, replacing `filename` with the name of the contract file:

```bash
npx hardhat test tests/filename
```

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by opening issues, providing solutions, or enhancing existing ones. Your insights and feedback are highly appreciated.

## Acknowledgments
